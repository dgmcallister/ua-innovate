## Prompt

### How can we use building energy use data to inform business decisions that can reduce costs for companies returning to the office? 

Use the [provided dataset](https://github.com/upkarlidder/ua-innovate/tree/main/dataset) from Women in Data Science (WiDS) and address the problem statement as either a data analyst OR data scientist as follows:
-	**As a data scientist** create a Machine learning Model that predicts energy efficiency for a building using the data features provide in the training dataset.

- **As a data analyst** create a Jupyter notebook, mobile application, or website that can show a dashboard that answer the  data analysis questions below for your manager (you can answer as many as you are able to):
   - how does energy usage vary from state to state?
   - are there any patterns in the data for energy usage throughout the year?
   - what does energy consumption look like for similar facility types?
   - what type of building is least and most efficient per sq footage?
   - how is energy consumption related to how old the facility is?
   - are newer buildings more energy efficient?
   - can you create a report to summarize the test data set?
      - are there any missing data?
      - how would you handle missing data?
      - are there any outliers?
      - provide statistics around numerical data?
      - do some columns have a large number of categories?


## Deliverables

To submit your entry for the Data Analaytics track, following the directions below (for either data analyst or data scientist).

Submit to Devpost:

**Data Analyst Team**:

One or more of the following for your dashboard (that answers one or more of the given data analysis questions):
- Jupyter notebook with data analytics 
- Website with dashboard that shows data analytics
- Mobile Application with dashboard that shows data analytics

Required:
- Data visualization charts that answer the relevant data analytics questions

**Data Scientist Team**
